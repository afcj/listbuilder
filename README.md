Notes regarding this app:
The core functionality of this app was done by someone called Ravi who posted it to the old Kings of War forum when 2nd Edition came out, so he gets 95% of the credit for this awesome tool! I (Guy) have just tweaked a couple of things and updated it for Clash of Kings packs and for 3rd edition. It's not meant to replace EasyArmy, and certainly doesn't have the advanced functionalities of EasyArmy, but rather should be viewed as a tool for casual list-building on your phone (/on the toilet) etc.

I plan to maintain this codebase in terms of changes and additions to the ruleset, fixing bugs, etc, but am not planning on adding any more functionality to it. I would very much welcome people contributing to the app by forking and submitting PRs - this is intended as a community project to help people play the game we know and love!

Todo:
- Add heights of unit to unit profiles
